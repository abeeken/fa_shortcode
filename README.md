# fa_shortcode
Fontawesome shortcode function for Wordpress - use it in your theme or plugin!

Once in place, just use i.e. [fa fa_code=fa.fa-bullhorn.fa-lg] and separate any attributes with a '.'

The function will add a i tag into your content with the correct classes.

You need to make sure you include the base fa or fab class.

NOTE: You still need to include the Fontawesome libraries into your Wordpress theme - find out more here: https://fontawesome.com/
